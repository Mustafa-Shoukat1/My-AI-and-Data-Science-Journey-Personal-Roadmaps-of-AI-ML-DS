### **Question 3: Karnaugh Map & Boolean Expression Simplification**

**(a) Use Karnaugh Maps to simplify the following Boolean functions:**

1. \( F(A, B, C) = \Sigma(1, 2, 5, 6, 7) \)  
2. \( F(A, B, C, D) = \Sigma(0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13) \)

**(b) Draw the simplified logic circuits based on the K-map simplifications:**

1. Simplified circuit for \( F(A, B, C) \)  
2. Simplified circuit for \( F(A, B, C, D) \)

---

### **Conclusion:**

In this assignment, I have applied the key concepts of number system conversions, Boolean algebra simplification, and Karnaugh maps. These are essential skills for designing and optimizing digital logic circuits, which are critical in the field of computer science and electronics.
