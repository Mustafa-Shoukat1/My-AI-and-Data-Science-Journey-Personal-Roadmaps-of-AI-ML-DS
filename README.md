## ðŸ¤– **Generative AI Engineer Roadmap**

---
The AI Engineering Roadmap categorizes the journey into 3 stages:
1. `Beginner` - Build the basic application to learn to consume LLM APIs, carefully engineering prompts for your applications, and working with open-source LLMs.

2. `Intermediate` - Go deep into building more context-aware advanced applications using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Learn about vector databases and how to work with one. Learn to build agents with LLMs and tools.

3. `Advanced` - After mastering application building, learn to deploy, optimize and manage LLM-powered apps in production with LLMOps. Learn to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt to downstream applications efficiently and at low cost.

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Continuously build projects, experiment with proof of concepts (POCs), or even launch real-world applications to hone your skills at each stage. Progress with practical experience!
