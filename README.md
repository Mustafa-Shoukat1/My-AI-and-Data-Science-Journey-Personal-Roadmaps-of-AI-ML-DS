The AI Engineering Roadmap categorizes the journey into 3 stages:
1. `Beginner` - Build a basic application to learn to consume LLM APIs, carefully engineering prompts for your applications and working with open source LLMs.

2. `Intermediate`â€”Go deep into building more context-aware advanced applications using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG). Learn about vector databases and how to work with one. Learn to build agents with LLMs and tools.

3. `Advanced` - After mastering application building, learn to deploy, optimize and manage LLM-powered apps in production with LLMOps. Learn to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt to downstream applications efficiently and at a low cost.
