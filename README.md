## ðŸ¤– AI Engineer Roadmap

### 1. **Beginner**
- Learn to build basic applications by consuming LLM APIs.
- Engineers prompt carefully to suit your application needs.
- Explore working with open-source LLMs.
  
### 2. **Intermediate**
- Dive deeper into building more context-aware applications using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- Learn about **vector databases** and how to integrate them into AI applications.
- Develop AI agents with LLMs and tools.

### 3. **Advanced**
- Master the deployment, optimization, and management of **LLM-powered applications** in production (**LLMOps**).
- Learn to fine-tune pre-trained models efficiently for downstream applications at low cost.
