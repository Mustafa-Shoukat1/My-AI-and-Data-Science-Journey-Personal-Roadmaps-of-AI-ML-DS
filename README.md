<h1> AI Engineer Roadmap & Resources ðŸ¤– </h1>
</div>


---
The AI Engineering Roadmap categorizes the journey into 3 stages:
1. `Beginner` - Build basic application to learn to consume LLM APIs, carefully engineering prompts for your applications and working with open source LLMs.

2. `Intermediate`â€”Go deep into building more context-aware advanced applications using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG). Learn about vector databases and how to work with one. Learn to build agents with LLMs and tools.

3. `Advanced` - After mastering application building, learn to deploy, optimize and manage LLM-powered apps in production with LLMOps. Learn to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt to downstream applications efficiently and at a low cost.

# Functional Product / Project Ideas to build the above skills

Here's the content of your HTML table converted into a well-formatted markdown table:

| S.No. | Project Idea | Skills required / to be developed |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
|       | **Beginner** |                                   |
| 1.    | Building a chatGPT / Midjourney -like bot for a niche persona / use-case and integrate it with WhatsApp or Slack or Discord or build an app using Streamlit / Gradio. | `LLMs`, `Prompt Engineering`, `open-source LLMs`, `Working with APIs`, `Python` |
| 2.    | Chrome extension to summarise / ideate / extract takeaways / research with web pages. | `LLM APIs`, `Prompt Engineering`, `open-source LLMs`, `Working with API`, `JS`, `HTML`,`CSS` |
| 3.    | Create a news aggregator for a targeted persona (PMs, AI Engg., ) | `Web Parsing`, `Prompt Engineering`, `LLMs` |
| 4.    | Multi-modal generation via Discord. | All of above and `Multi-modal generation` |
|       | **Intermediate** |                                   |
| 5.    | `Q&A bot for specific persona` / department - Doctor / Lawyer / Engineer, Marketer, Sales etc. | `text splitting`, `chunking`, `indexing`, `working with vector databases`, `building RAG pipelines`, `deploying apps` |
| 6.    | `StackOverflow-like search engine` that provides response from multiple data sources - Advanced RAG pipeline to answer complex query using multiple data sources. | All above and `vector retrieval`, `summary retrieval`, `sub-question query engine`, `deploying apps` |
| 7.    | AI Interview Buddy - an AI agent that helps in preparing for specific roles in an interactive manner. | `Building agents`, `agentic design`, `text-to-speech`, `speech-to-text`, `deployment` |
|       | **Advanced** |                                   |
| 8.    | Personal assistant fine-tuned on domain-specific data. Personal Healthcare, Countryâ€™s Law, Finance, etc. | `Dataset curation`, `Data engineering`, `model evaluation`, `benchmarking`, `PEFT`, `LoRA`, `QLoRA` |
| 9.    | An e2e e-commerce product assistant. | `Advanced RAG pipeline`, `LLMOps` - `Data Engineering`, `CI/CD`, `Scaling`, `Monitoring`, `Observability` |
| 10.   | InvestGPT - fine-tuned LLM to classify personal investments based on technical (algorithmic) and fundamental (LLMs) analysis. | `fine tuning`, `evals and benchmarking`, `AI Security` |

You can extrapolate each of these ideas into full-fledged products / MVPs for different domains, industries and verticals.
